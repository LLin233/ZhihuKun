# ZhihuKun
A custom client that just started to be built within [zhihu-API](https://github.com/izzyleung/ZhihuDailyPurify/wiki/%E7%9F%A5%E4%B9%8E%E6%97%A5%E6%8A%A5-API-%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90)

I am going to 
apply some of the components in the Android.support.design,
and implement it with RxJava style.
